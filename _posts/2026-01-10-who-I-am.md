I am Larry Lee, TAMS Materials Science and Engineering class of 2027, the current TAMS MAO president for the year of 2026, and TAMS A team member for the year of 2025.

I wanted to start a blog because I wanted to keep note of what my thoughts are and present some interesting thoughts like Evan Chan would, and to keep my future blogs to send to MAO such as LaTeX guides.

If there are any questions you would like to ask please send me a message through any social media where you can find me, while I am in TAMS messanger is best, and after I graduate from TAMS email would be best to ask about where to contact.
