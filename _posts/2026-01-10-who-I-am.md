Depending on who you are, you may know me from different aspects. Larry Lee. TAMS Materials Science and Engineering class of 2027. TAMS MAO President and A Team member. ENTJ-T

I wanted to start a blog because I wanted to keep note of what my thoughts are and present some interesting thoughts like Evan Chan would.

If there are any questions you would like to ask please send me a message through any social media where you can find me.
